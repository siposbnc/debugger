# DEBUGGER — Game Design Document

*A roguelite survivors-like where a developer hunts literal bugs. This document is the
condensed design package for the implemented v1 (web build, TypeScript + Canvas).*

---

## 1. Elevator pitch

You are a developer trapped inside a corrupted software world. Bugs, memory leaks and
stack overflows have become monsters. Survive 15 minutes of escalating swarms, level up
through punny upgrade cards, evolve your dev tools into legendary weapons, defeat a boss
every two minutes, and spend earned **Bits** on permanent upgrades. *Vampire Survivors
meets a stand-up routine about production incidents.*

## 2. Core pillars

1. **Debugging as combat** — every system, name and joke maps to real software culture.
2. **Readable chaos** — hundreds of enemies, always legible (isometric, strong color language).
3. **One more run** — Bits, unlocks and objectives always leave a next goal.
4. **Funny, not a joke game** — humor in names/flavor; numbers and mechanics stay serious.

## 3. Target player experience

Minute 0–2: power fantasy onboarding. Minute 2–8: build crafting under growing pressure.
Minute 8–15: bullet-heaven crescendo where a good build pops the screen. Death always
converts into Bits → visible permanent progress.

## 4. Core gameplay loop

Move (WASD) → weapons auto-fire → bugs drop XP gems → gems magnetize → level up →
pick 1 of 3 cards → grow stronger → boss every 2:00 → chest (evolution or bonus card) →
die or stabilize the system at 15:00 → Bits → meta shop → run again.

## 5. Run structure

| Time | Event |
|---|---|
| 0:00 | Spawns begin (Syntax Mites) |
| each min | Difficulty director: HP ×(1+0.24t+0.015t²), DMG ×(1+0.11t), spawn interval ×0.915ᵗ |
| 2:00 / 4:00 / … | Boss (5s warning banner), from the map's `bossOrder`, cycling with tier scaling |
| 4:00+ | Elites: chance 1.5% +0.8%/min — ×9 HP, ×10 XP, gold aura, may drop coffee (heal) |
| 15:00 | **SYSTEM STABILIZED** — victory |

## 6. Permanent progression structure

13 meta upgrades (cost = base × 1.55–1.9^level): starting HP/damage/speed/pickup/XP/
regen/armor/luck, +reroll/+banish/+defer, +1 weapon slot (4→5), boss-reward +25%/lvl.
Plus unlocks: 3 characters (250/450/700 ⌬), 4 weapons (200–600 ⌬), 1 map (500 ⌬).

## 7. Bits economy

`Bits = (min×10 + kills×0.1 + bosses×50×bossRewardMult + level×5 + objectives×100) × mapMult`
Measured yields (headless sim): first runs ~300–700, strong victory run ~1500–2100.
First meta purchases land after 1–2 runs; full shop ≈ 25–35 runs.

## 8. Character roster

| Name | Archetype | Weapon | Passive |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ada Commit** (starter) | Full-Stack Dev | Syntax Wand | +10% XP |
| **Max Pipeline** | DevOps | Deployment Hammer | Auto-turret node every 12s (10s life) |
| **Nia Nullguard** | QA Tester | Assertion Blades | +5% crit, +25% crit vs elites/bosses |
| **Linus Patchwell** | OSS Maintainer | Garbage Collector | Helper process every 16s (9s life) |

## 9. Weapon roster (8 + 8 evolutions)

| Weapon | Kind | Behavior | Evolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Syntax Wand | bolt | code bolts at nearest | Compiler's Scepter (5 piercing fast bolts) |
| Deployment Hammer | shockwave | radial slam + knockback | Release Breaker (double wave + stun) |
| Assertion Blades | orbit | orbiting blades | Test Suite Halo (8 blades, wide) |
| Garbage Collector | sweep | melee arc, deletes weakened small bugs | Heap Purifier (360°, absorbs heal 1 HP) |
| Regex Grimoire | chain | beam chaining between bugs | The Perfect Match (marks: +25% dmg taken) |
| Stack Staff | column | force columns on random targets | Overflow Spire (recursive 3-column lines) |
| Daemon Familiar | pet | orbiting shooter pet | Process Legion (5 pets, rapid fire) |
| Breakpoint Bow | snipe | piercing slowing shot | Timefreeze Debugger (pierce-all freeze) |

8 levels each; **evolution**: weapon at max level + collect a boss chest.

## 10–11. Upgrade card system

3 cards per level-up; pool = weapon level-ups (weight 70), new weapons (30), 32 stat
cards (rarity-weighted: 50/28/13/5/1.4, halved per-card; luck multiplies rare+ weights).
Reroll/banish/defer are meta-unlocked (Defer takes no card and banks 20% of the
next level's XP requirement — momentum without power). Examples: **Hotfix** (+8% dmg, C),
**Rubber Duck Insight** (+1 luck +10% XP, R), **Merge Conflict** (+40% dmg −10 HP, E),
**The 10x Developer** (+10% everything, L). Full list: `src/data/upgrades.ts`.

## 12. Enemy roster

Syntax Mite (swarm), Cache Tick (cluster ×6), Null Pointer Wasp (charge dash),
Memory Leech (drain + self-heal), Race Condition Spider (jitter + duplicates),
Exception Beetle (death explosion), Deadlock Scarab (player slow aura),
Stack Overflow Centipede (segmented tank). Stats: `src/data/enemies.ts`.

## 13. Boss roster

Every boss is two-layered (v0.3 boss mechanics pass): layer 1 is the attack
pattern (a movement check), layer 2 bends a rule to test the **build** — DPS
checks, soft enrages, interrupt thresholds. Rationale: pre-v0.3 bosses were
"different attack patterns, not unique fights" and fell to pure dodge/kite play;
a boss should be a challenge precisely when the build is weak. Tuning constants
live at the top of `src/game/bossLogic.ts`.

| Boss | Layer 1: pattern | Layer 2: build test |
|---|---|---|
| The Merge Conflict | splits into two at 50% HP — both must die | halves linked by a damaging diff tether; >30% HP gap force-push enrages the stronger half (+50% dmg, +60% speed) until the gap closes below 15% → spread your damage |
| The Memory Leak | drips damage pools | pools never expire while it lives (cap 28, oldest paged out) — soft-enrage DPS check; death frees every pool at once |
| The Infinite Loop | radial bursts, faster each cycle | snapshots your position every 7s and rewinds you to it 2.5s later (marker shown) → plan positions, end the fight before the bursts compound |
| The Stack Overflow | summons recursive mites + aimed triple shots | live mites are stack frames: 50% damage resist while any live; clearing the stack pops it — 2.5s stun at full vulnerability (10s pop cooldown) → add-clear/AoE check |
| The Legacy Monolith | armored phase (75% resist) ↔ exposed core | armor spawns 3 Deprecated Dependency pillars that soak shots/auto-aim; breaking one ends the armor early with a +1s exposed window → target-priority DPS check |

Tier scaling: HP ×(1+0.35·tier), DMG ×(1+0.15·tier); order cycles past 10:00.

## 14. Maps

**Greenfield Repository** (starter): corrupted meadow, full pool, ×1.0 Bits.
**Memory Marsh** (500 ⌬): leech-heavy, static toxic pools (slow + dps), ×1.25 Bits.
Future biomes (post-MVP): Stack Canyon, Production Server, Cloud Citadel, Cyber Glacier,
Firewall Bastion, Legacy Ruins, Nullwood Forest.

## 15–16. Objectives & unlocks

12 one-time objectives (+100 ⌬ each, checked live, persisted): survive 5/10/15, kill
500/1500, level 10/20, boss 1/3, evolve a weapon, collect 500 XP, marsh 10-min.
Unlock surface = objectives (Bits) + shop (characters/weapons/maps/meta).

## 17. Difficulty scaling model

See §5. Knobs live in `difficulty()` (`src/data/enemies.ts`) and per-map `spawnPlan`
phase tables (interval + enemy weights per minute band). Enemy cap 380.

## 18. UI/UX

In-run HUD: XP bar + level (top), timer, kill & live-Bits counters, next-boss countdown,
boss HP bar, weapon icons + levels, HP bar, banner system (boss warning, objective,
evolution). Level-up modal: 3 rarity-glowing cards + reroll/banish/defer. Menus: start,
characters, maps, shop, codex (stats/bugs/incidents/objectives), settings. Post-run:
victory/defeat header, stat rows, itemized Bits breakdown.

## 19. Art direction

"Corrupted IDE" terminal-fantasy: near-black blue-green field, phosphor green/cyan =
player power, red/orange/purple = corruption, gold = rarity/reward. Procedurally drawn
glowing bugs (big eyes, software-glyph markings), 2:1 isometric diamond tiles with
circuit traces and corruption patches, CRT scanline overlay, glitch-square death
particles, VT323 + IBM Plex Mono.

## 20. Audio direction

100% synthesized WebAudio: square-wave shoot blips, glitch noise kills, alarm boss
warnings, arpeggio fanfares. Music: generative A-minor synthwave loop (bass, arpeggio,
hats) whose density/octaves rise with `intensity` = time/10min.

## 21. Game feel

Hit-flash, knockback, screen shake (scaled by event weight), floating damage numbers
(crits gold + larger), XP magnet streams, level-up screen flash, chest jingles, boss
death particle showers. Shake is toggleable.

## 22. First 10 minutes (intended)

0:00 lone wand bolts → 1:30 first card → 2:00 Merge Conflict (panic, kite, win ≈3:30)
→ chest → second weapon online → 5:00 objective banner + Smoke Test ⌬ → 6:00 Infinite
Loop forces movement through bullet rings → 8:00 build crystallizes (third weapon,
first epic card) → 10:00 Legacy Monolith phase-dance while trash floods the screen.

## 23. First 5 runs (intended)

R1: die ~7–9 min, ~400 ⌬ → buy HP + damage. R2: die ~10 min, unlock Regex Grimoire.
R3: first 15:00 victory attempt, unlock Max Pipeline. R4: Memory Marsh attempt.
R5: first evolution + Senior promotion objective; shop ~30% complete.

## 24. Data schemas

All content data-driven under `src/data/`: `types.ts` defines `WeaponDef` (kind +
8-level stat tables), `EnemyDef` (behavior + flags), `BossDef` (mechanic key),
`UpgradeCard` (StatMods), `CharacterDef`, `MapDef` (palette, spawnPlan, bossOrder),
`MetaUpgradeDef`, `ObjectiveDef` (predicate over `RunStatsView`). Adding content =
adding a record; behaviors are keyed enums handled in `src/game/`.

## 25. MVP scope — ✅ implemented

Everything above: 8+8 weapons, 8 enemies + elites, 5 bosses, 32 cards, 4 characters,
2 maps, 13 meta upgrades, 12 objectives, save/load, full menu flow, synth audio,
victory at 15:00, headless balance simulator (`scripts/simulate.ts`).

## 26. Post-MVP ideas

More biomes w/ unique hazards; weekly seeded challenge; passive item slots (split from
stat cards); curses/difficulty modifiers for Bits multipliers; achievements→cosmetics;
in-run events (bug nests, broken terminals to repair); controller support; meta tree UI;
Endless mode past 15:00; localized wordplay.

## 27. Balance recommendations

Keep kill rate ≥ spawn rate before minute 6 for any starting weapon (sim-verified:
wand ~100 kills by 2:00). First boss TTK target 60–100s. Watch: Assertion Blades scale
hardest with cooldown builds; Exception Beetle density above minute 10 (explosion
stacking); Bits inflation from objective re-runs is impossible (one-time) — main faucet
is boss kills, gated by bossRewardMult price.

## 28. Risks & design challenges

- **Perf**: capped at 380 enemies, baked sprites, spatial hash; degrade gracefully by lowering cap.
- **Late-run legibility**: enforced palette separation (player=cool, enemy=warm) + damage-number cap.
- **The stationary degenerate strategy**: drains (leech), pools, scarab slows and charge
  dashes all punish standing still.
- **The running degenerate strategy**: the player (150 u/s) outpaces every enemy at any
  difficulty, so outrun enemies past ~1150 units are recycled onto the spawn ring around
  the player (`spawner.ts`). The horde can be dodged but never shed — kill rate, not
  movement speed, decides survival. Mortal-bot win-rate targets: BALANCE.md §5.
- **Joke fatigue**: humor lives in flavor text only; mechanical text stays literal.

## 29. Roadmap

v0.1 (this build) → v0.2 polish: pause-menu stat sheet, minimap, gamepad →
v0.3 content: 2 biomes, 4 weapons, 8 characters → v0.4 challenge/endless modes →
v1.0: Steam wrap (Electron/Tauri), achievements, localization.
